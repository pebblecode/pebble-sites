    <h2>Turbo-charging innovation</h2>
    <p>AZ ran innovation competitions for new ideas, they attracted a relatively small group of people. The ideas were always submitted as lengthy academic documents which limited the number of people capable of suggesting or appraising ideas.</p>
    <p>So they missed out on the power of the collective brainpower available.</p>

  <div class="az-inovation-after">
    <p>We developed a collaborative innovation tool, creating a place where new ideas can be captured, shared and appraised anytime, anywhere by anyone</p>
    <p>Ideas start out as 140 character chunks. The crowd vote on the most attractive and only those selected by the crowd are developed any further.</p>
    <p>All participants get rewarded for being involved. This gets more people than ever from within the organisation involved in innovation.</p>
    <p>Ideas are improved by wider collaboration into more rounded concepts, making the real-world application of the ideas more likely.</p>
