Any nervousness about having remote support disappeared within hours of them starting - with the slickest ticketing system, friendly and engaged support engineers and an incredibly impressive response time to more urgent requests - they blew us away. Their Mac knowledge is deep - and their ability to diagnose and fix was swift. They also helped us plan ahead for upgrades and spend over the forthcoming year and took us from a good place in terms of infrastructure to a really solid place. The only reason we don't use them now is because we sold our business and the new owner has in house IT. It is no understatement to say we miss Pebble hugely.</p>",
