            <p>Working with <span>pebble.it</span> has been both pleasurable and painless; two words not commonly associated with company IT needs. Their rates are competitive and they work quickly, effectively and without fuss. We wholeheartedly recommend
              their services.</p>

            <p><span>pebble.it</span> was our first experience of outsourcing IT having previously had a dedicated one or two man team in house. Any nervousness about having remote support disappeared within hours of them starting - with the slickest ticketing
              system, friendly and engaged support engineers and an incredibly impressive response time to more urgent requests - they blew us away. Their Mac knowledge is deep - and their ability to diagnose and fix was swift. They also helped us plan
              ahead for upgrades and spend over the forthcoming year and took us from a good place in terms of infrastructure to a really solid place. The only reason we don't use them now is because we sold our business and the new owner has in house
              IT. It is no understatement to say we miss Pebble hugely.</p>
